# Title

Trends detection on Twitter

# Abstract

Through the years, Twitter has grown in one of principal sources of trends in the world. The goal of this project is to detect trends in tweets. In order to achieve this, we extract the topics using LDA jointly with the finding and discussion of the top trends per month in 2014.


# Research questions

After a feasibility check, the overall goal of our project was redefined. Indeed, assessing the veracity of news would have been out of the scope of this project. The new research questions are stated below:

Main research question : 

- Which topics are the most tweeted (retweeted) and spread the fastest in time ?

Additional research questions:

- What are the most used hashtags per month ?

- What are the most popular users on Twitter ?

# Dataset:

Given that the Twitter dataset is huge we are going to take into account only english tweets in a certain period (the year 2014). We are going to use topic extraction techniques to find “the hottest” subjects. Then we will apply exploratory data analysis to get a better and deeper understanding of the data on Twitter.


# Contributions of each group member:

Anh Nghia Khau: finding and implementing an algorithm for topic extraction(LDA), preliminary data analysis, writing up the report, cleaning and commenting the code, working on the poster

Sandra Djambazovska: data analysis on hashtags and most popular users, writting up the report, updating the README file, cleaning and commenting the code, working on the poster

Camille Renner: writing up the report, updating the README file, working on the poster,  presentation of the poster

# Opportunity for further analysis

Additional research questions:

General:

- Is there pattern of trends over time (rapid increase, rapid decrease, persistent trend.. ) according to topics?  

- Are certain trends connected to each other?
