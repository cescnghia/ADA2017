# Title

Trends detection on Twitter

# Abstract

Through the years, Twitter has grown in one of principal sources of trends in the world. The goal of this project is to detect trends in tweets. In order to achieve this, we extract the topics using LDA jointly with the finding and discussion of the top trends per month in 2014.


# Research questions

After a feasibility check, the overall goal of our project was redefined. Indeed, assessing the veracity of news would have been out of the scope of this project. The new research questions are stated below:

Main research question : 

- Which topics are the most tweeted (retweeted) and spread the fastest in time and place?


# Dataset:

Given that the Twitter dataset is huge we are going to take into account only the tweets in a certain period (the year 2014). We are going to use topic extraction techniques to find “the hottest” subjects. Then we will apply exploratory data analysis to get a better and deeper understanding of the data on Twitter.


# Opportunity for further analysis

Additional research questions:

General:

- After how much time the top trend changes?

- Is there pattern of trends over time (rapid increase, rapid decrease, persistent trend.. ) according to topics?  

- Are certain trends connected to each other?

Language differentiation: 

- Do trends have the same speed within one language or between the different languages?

- Do we have the same trends in the three languages that we have in our datasets? Do they grow simultaneously or is there a time gap between trends. Do one language influences the others?

- What proportion of trends created in one language spreads to other languages?
